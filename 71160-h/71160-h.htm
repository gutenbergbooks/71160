<p><em>Whether you take candymaking seriously or like to
make it only for special occasions, you will find the recipes
for the most popular homemade candy in this
folder. They were developed in the Best Foods Karo
Kitchens, where candymaking is taken seriously. Karo
syrup in the candy mixture helps to give a smooth,
creamy texture as in fudge, a soft chewy texture as in
taffy or a crisp non-sticky texture as in peanut brittle
or candy apples.</em></p>

<p>Mix together sugar, corn syrup, water and salt in
2-quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture comes to boil. Reduce heat;
cook without stirring until temperature reaches 248°F.,
or until a small amount of mixture dropped into very
cold water forms a firm ball which does not flatten on
removal from water. Just before temperature reaches
248°F., beat egg whites in large bowl until stiff but not
dry. Beating constantly, on high speed of electric
mixer, slowly pour about ½ the hot syrup over egg
whites. Then cook remaining syrup to 272°F., or until
a small amount separates into threads which are hard
but not brittle when dropped into very cold water.
Beating constantly, pour hot syrup over first mixture
about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each
addition. Continue beating until mixture begins to lose
its gloss and a small amount of mixture holds soft peak
when dropped from spoon. (If mixture becomes too
stiff for mixer, beat with wooden spoon.) Mix in vanilla
and nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper.
Makes 1¼ pounds or 48 pieces.</p>

reaches 250°F. or until small amount of syrup
dropped into very cold water forms a ball which is hard
enough to hold its shape, yet plastic. Add cinnamon
candies and continue cooking to 285°F. or until small
amount of syrup dropped into very cold water separates

apple from syrup; allow excess to drip off, then twirl
to spread syrup smoothly over apple. Place on lightly
greased baking sheet to cool. Store in cool place.
